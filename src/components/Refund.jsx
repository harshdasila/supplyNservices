            <li className="mb-4"><span className='font-bold'>Business users:</span> This charge applies to all returns, regardless of whether the goods are faulty or not. Consumer users, however, may be eligible for a refund or replacement under our returns and refunds policy, which can be found on our website. In all cases, we recommend contacting our Customer Services Department before returning any goods to ensure that you are aware of the correct process and any associated charges.

            <li className="mb-4"><span className='font-bold'>Customers</span>: This is our returns policy for consumer users who have changed their mind about their purchase. It's important to confirm your request in writing as this provides us with a clear and documented record of your return request. This helps to ensure that there are no misunderstandings or disputes further down the line. Please include your order number and details of the goods you wish to return in your written confirmation. We will process your return as soon as we receive your written confirmation and provide you with a refund or replacement, as appropriate. If you have any questions about our returns policy, please don't hesitate to contact our Customer Services Department.

            <li className="mb-4">This applies to both business and consumer users who are returning goods due to a fault or defect. To be eligible for a refund, the goods must be returned in their original condition, including all relevant packaging. This helps to ensure that the goods are returned in a saleable condition and minimizes any potential damage during transportation. We recommend using a tracked and insured delivery service to ensure that the goods are returned safely and that we can trace their return. Once we receive the returned goods, we will process your refund as soon as possible or within 15 days. If you have any questions about our returns policy, please don't hesitate to contact our Customer Services Department.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">This applies to both business and consumer users who are returning goods without prior authorization or in a condition other than that set out in our returns policy. If we receive goods that do not meet our returns criteria, we reserve the right to reject them and return them to you at your cost. This helps to ensure that we can maintain the quality of our products and minimize any potential damage during transportation. We strongly recommend that you contact our Customer Services Department before returning any goods to ensure that they meet our returns criteria and that you are aware of any associated costs. This will help to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes further down the line.
            </li>
            <li className="mb-4">This clause outlines our legal obligation to provide a refund within 15 days of receiving returned goods, in line with consumer protection laws. However, we reserve the right to charge you the direct costs of recovery if you fail to return the goods after a full refund has been issued. This is to cover any expenses incurred in pursuing the return of the goods. We strongly recommend that you return the goods as soon as possible to avoid any additional charges. It's also important to note that if any provision of these terms and conditions is found to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, it will be excluded without affecting the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. Any disputes that cannot be resolved through our normal complaints procedure will be resolved exclusively in accordance with United States law. This helps to ensure that any disputes are resolved fairly and efficiently, in line with local legal requirements.
